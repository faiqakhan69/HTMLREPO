<p style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Wildlife experts cite habitat alteration, pollution, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850949" target="-blank">poaching</a> and
 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1348661" target="_blank">illegal</a> trade as major factors behind the decline in the bird’s population, which is 
still the largest among the three parrot species found in the South Asian country.</p>


<p>The tree-filled foothills of the scenic Murree Hill Station are another home to Alexandrine parrots.</p>

<p>Speaking to Anadolu, Ali observed that a huge number of Indian rosewood (Shisham or Tali) and Banyan (Ficus benghalensis) trees, the parrots’
 favourite nesting places, has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1503365" target="_blank">stematically cut down </a>in the agriculture belt of Punjab and Sindh over the past three decades because of their
 precious wood.</p>

<p>Eucalyptus in Pakistan was exported from Australia to feed the country’s matchstick industry and according to some environmentalists,
 it is environmentally hazardous.</p>

    The parrots play an important role in seed dispersal, while their nests serve as hibernation sites for several animals, mainly snakes and some squirrel species in the winter.

    Many parrot species are in decline, and several are extinct. Of the 350 living species, some 130 are listed as near threatened or worse by the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/search?query=parrots&searchType=species" target="_blank">International Union for Conservation of Nature.</a>
 </p>
 <p>
    The bird’s population in Pakistan has not been estimated.The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad_Wildlife_Management_Board" target="-blank">IWMB</a> in December last year launched an “action plan” in the capital to contain the consistent decrease in the parrots’ population.
  </p>
    
   <p>
    “We have registered over 50 breeders and 178 individuals (pet lovers) keeping over 2,200 parrots to ensure they cannot sell these birds into the market. Even their hatchlings will be registered,” said Ali, who also serves as deputy director of research at IWMB.

    The Alexandrine parrot is the largest parrot species found in the country. They have red patches on their wings and are green in colour, with mutations also occurring.

   According to Anis Rehman, a wildlife expert based in Islamabad, the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) is named after Alexander the Great, who is said to have first sent several of the birds from Punjab to the West, where they became popular as exotic pets of rich and noble families.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to its large size, this species has the ability to mimic human speech, which makes it one of the most wanted birds by pet lovers, he added. A chick can earn a poacher Rs10,000-Rs12,000, while an adult Alexandrine parrot is sold for up to Rs50,000 in pet markets, according to Rehman.
  </p>
  <p>
    “If a poacher catches a group of five to 10 hatchlings and parrots in a month, he can easily earn between Rs100,000 and Rs150,000, which is almost four times higher than the minimum [monthly] salary of Rs37,000,” he said.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aside from pet lovers, <a href="https://www.probreeders.com/" target="-blank"> professional breeders</a> breeders also buy wild parrots to crossbreed them with their bred species to improve the latter’s immunity.
